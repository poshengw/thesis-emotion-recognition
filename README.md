# Using Support Vector Machine for Emotion Classification in presence of Noise Label

### Overview
This research is implemented in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and the facial expression dataset was provided by [Michael Lyons, Miyuki Kamachi, and Jiro Gyoba](http://www.kasrl.org/jaffe.html). There are 5 different emotions (Anger, Disgust, Happy, Sad and Neutral) we are targeting at and want to clasify. The goal of this thesis is to perform Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier under the circumstance that the data true labels are ambiguous.
